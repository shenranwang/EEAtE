What is energy efficiency? ;TedxBoulder - James Brew - The Value of Energy Efficiency;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9l8zingLjE;Energy efficiency simply means using less energy to perform the same task – that is, eliminating energy waste. Energy efficiency brings a variety of benefits: reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing demand for energy imports, and lowering our costs on a household and economy-wide level. While renewable energy technologies also help accomplish these objectives, improving energy efficiency is the cheapest – and often the most immediate – way to reduce the use of fossil fuels. There are enormous opportunities for efficiency improvements in every sector of the economy, whether it is buildings, transportation, industry, or energy generation.;;;https://www.eesi.org/topics/energy-efficiency/description

What is energy efficiency in logistics?;;;"Logistics operations are energy-consuming and impact the environment negatively. Improving energy efficiency in logistics is crucial for environmental sustainability and can be achieved by increasing the utilisation of capacity. Over-delivery of logistics services, incorrect price setting, and sales campaigns can cause un-utilised capacity.
Actors in logistics and freight transport face increased pressure to reduce the climate impact of their operations and to become more environmentally sustainable.

How can ecommerce be more energy efficient?;;;"Things to do to become a more Energy-Efficient Ecommerce: cutting back on packaging waste; recycled packaging; offering picking up alternatives to avoid packaging; to have one large delivery to one pickup location than to have smaller deliveries to various addresses; tracking your carbon  footprints; allow more remote working.";;;
What are the forms of energy waste in ecommerce?;;;Which uses more energy on average: a traditional brick-and-mortar store, or an Ecommerce store? The truth is that it depends on the exact circumstances. People can often walk to physical stores to collect their products, which cuts down on shipping costs. But there’s the matter of packaging waste. E-commerce logistics can be highly sophisticated.;;;
;;;The more you implement automation tools and smart monitoring, the denser that web will become. This can start to use a lot of energy.;;;
What are Ecommerce’s effects on energy consumption?;;;E-commerce increases energy consumption mainly through increases in transportation and logistics, and increases in the residential and commercial sectors.;;;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jiec.12639
;;;For e-commerce, first-order effects capture energy consumption by hardware (e.g., Amazon's server farms), second-order effects entail the consequences of e-commerce due to substitution or process transformation (e.g., fewer visits to the mall but more cardboard boxes), and third-order effects cover changes in the system and related feedback effects. ;;;
What is the relationship between commerce and energy?;;;E-commerce: Convenience built on a mountain of cardboard”;;;
;;; If e-commerce increases the efficiency of a supply chain, the lower costs and prices could increase demand. E-commerce also alters consumers’ lifestyles, for example, it could shift their use of their spare time from going to the mall to other energy-demanding activities.;;;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jiec.12639
What are the environmental effects of all information and communication technologies ICT?;;;In theory, the environmental effects of all information and communication technology (ICT) can be distinguished as first, second, and third order. ;;;
;;;Many studies offer conflicting implications for environmental policy, even when investigating seemingly digital-friendly supply chains (e.g., digital versus physical media distribution).;;;
What to do to make  home energy efficient?;;;We need more effective public awareness advertising campaigns to modify consumer behaviour and reduce waste.;;;

What are the misconceptions about energy efficiency?;Five energy-efficiency myths debunked;;From freezers to fans, there are many misconceptions about how to save energy. In some cases, if you follow the advice of these false claims, you could even drive up your energy costs!;;;https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy-efficiency/spotlight-energy-efficiency/2021/03/21/five-energy-efficiency-myths-debunked/23417
;;;"“Leaving my fan on in the summer will cool the room”; “When I turn off my electronics and appliances, they stop using energy”; “The bigger the central A/C unit, the better it will perform”; It’s cheaper to keep the heat on all the time on a low setting; Sleep mode or hibernate mode is just fine for computers overnight. ";;;
;;;Ceiling fans cool people by increasing airflow. The movement of air over your skin dries up sweat or moisture on your skin’s surface making you feel cooler, but in most homes, there is no cooling effect to the room overall. So turn the fan off when you’re away from the room to save energy!;;;
;;;An oversized air conditioning unit is actually less effective because although it’ll cool the room, it might not stay on long enough to properly dehumidify the space. This will leave some of the humidity and create a damp, clammy feeling in the room. A unit that’s the right size for the job will deliver maximum comfort and savings. Get a certified air conditioning contractor to properly size your ENERGY STAR certified A/C unit.;;;
What lights save energy?;;;Less halogens, less emissions;;;
;;;Halogen lamps, while providing bright and high quality lighting, use a large amount of energy, which is mostly wasted in the form of heat. LEDs generally use one-sixth the energy of halogen bulbs and typically last 20 times longer. It is estimated that the phasing out of halogens in Europe will avoid more than 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year, an amount equal to greenhouse gas emissions from over 3 million passenger cars driven for one year.;;;
Is ICT/Digitization part of the environmental problem or part of the solution?;;;Information on the environmental impacts of the ICT sector is fragmented and partly inconsistent. The two faces of the ICT sector: consuming energy and materials while also paving the way to a carbon-neutral society.;;;https://www.lvm.fi/-/the-two-faces-of-the-ict-sector-consuming-energy-and-materials-while-also-paving-the-way-to-a-carbon-neutral-society-1210283
;;;ICT can deliver substantial environmental benefits by replacing products with services, through telecommuting, and in streamlining manufacturing processes. On the other hand, communication networks, data centres and smart devices require electric power and materials, and are also a source of greenhouse gas emissions.;;;
;;;“ICT is an integral part of modern society and an effective instrument in work to mitigate climate change, but we must also pay attention to rising consumption of energy and materials in the sector,” explains Päivi Antikainen of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, who chaired its working group to develop a climate and environmental strategy for the ICT sector.;;;
How much is the energy consumption in ICT sector?;;;"The power source determines greenhouse gas emissions.
Electric power consumption is the principal cause of greenhouse gas emissions in the ICT sector, which uses 4-10 per cent of the world’s electricity and generates 1.5-5 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions, according to various estimates.";;;https://www.lvm.fi/-/the-two-faces-of-the-ict-sector-consuming-energy-and-materials-while-also-paving-the-way-to-a-carbon-neutral-society-1210283
What is the energy consumption level in ICT sector?;;;The power consumption of the sector in Finland is quite moderate by global standards. The ICT sector has only a minimal impact on greenhouse gas emissions in Finland, as most of the nation’s electricity supply has been decarbonised. The ICT sector services used in Finland nevertheless also cause emissions outside the country, as a substantial part of these services come from foreign suppliers.;;;https://www.lvm.fi/-/the-two-faces-of-the-ict-sector-consuming-energy-and-materials-while-also-paving-the-way-to-a-carbon-neutral-society-1210283
;;;Thanks to improved energy efficiency, ICT sector electric power consumption has not risen in proportion to data volumes. For example, some highly energy-efficient data centres have been designed and constructed in Finland in recent years, with active measures taken to use the surplus heat that they release.;;;
;;;Data volumes are nevertheless growing rapidly. Forecasts suggest a nearly fourfold increase in global Internet traffic over the period from 2017 to 2022. Even though Finnish mobile networks cut the average energy consumption of data transmission by more than 80 per cent between 2014 and 2018, this coincided with a more than sixfold increase in the volume of data exchanged on those networks by the end of this period. Greater volumes of data are now being processed with the proliferation of new technologies and applications, such as artificial intelligence, making energy efficiency an important factor to consider and accommodate.;;;
Is electronic waste a big environmental concern?;;;Decommissioned electronic equipment is the world’s fastest growing waste type, increasing by nearly 7 per cent annually. Smart devices, such as computers and phones, are rapidly replaced with low recycling rates. Even the recovery rate of rare earth metals is estimated at only one per cent.;;;https://www.lvm.fi/-/the-two-faces-of-the-ict-sector-consuming-energy-and-materials-while-also-paving-the-way-to-a-carbon-neutral-society-1210283
Is car battery a big environmental concern?;;;;;;
Where Do Electric Cars’ Batteries Go To?;;;In the conventional car industry, according to a study from the international council of clean transportation (ICCT), 99% of lead-acid batteries (the ones running in fossil fuel powered cars) are recycled in the US. This is not the case for the lithium-ion batteries that have a very specific mix of chemical components and little quantities of lithium, which doesn’t make them an appealing market opportunity. For instance, in the EU market, in 2011, only 5% of lithium was being collected and the rest was either incinerated or dumped in landfills (this specifically doesn’t make electric cars greener at all), as it was not justified by price or regulations to recover it by hydrometallurgical processes.;;;
Are electric car battery Recycled In An Eco-Friendly Way?;;;One solution might have to do with reusing these batteries and giving them a second life since they are able to support the electric grid of buildings and to store energy from wind or solar electricity sources. This would also help offset the environmental impacts of making the batteries in the first place since they are amortized over a longer period of time.;;;
Are Electric Cars Really Eco-Friendly And Zero Emissions?;;;No, electric cars they are not zero emissions vehicles. We have seen that although they do not emit CO2 while being driven, they might do it in 3 other stages: during manufacturing, energy production and at the end of their life cycle. In the first case, the need for mining activities to extract the rare earth metals that are used in batteries is very energy consuming and polluting.;;;https://youmatter.world/en/are-electric-cars-eco-friendly-and-zero-emission-vehicles-26440/
;;;If the car is being powered with energy from burning fossil fuels, it is still releasing CO2 in the atmosphere. When it comes to batteries being recycled, it is still an expensive and ongoing process and most batteries are not being recycled yet. In spite of this, solutions to make electric cars greener and more eco-friendly and sustainable are being developed.;;;
Does The Manufacturing Of Electric Cars Have Zero Emissions?;;;The cycle of making a car starts with raw materials being extracted, refined, transported and manufactured into several components that will be assembled to produce the car itself. This process is very much the same in both conventional and electric cars. Nevertheless, at the end of the manufacturing process, electric cars are the ones generating more carbon emissions, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.;;;https://youmatter.world/en/are-electric-cars-eco-friendly-and-zero-emission-vehicles-26440/
;;;Electrical car batteries are made of rare earth elements (REE) like lithium, nickel, cobalt or graphite that only exist beneath the surface of the Earth and therefore depend on mining activities with very polluting processes. ;;;
Why does energy efficiency in the agro-food chain matter?;;;For a variety of reasons, energy use in the agro-food sector continues to rise, and in many countries, is highly dependent on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. It is therefore becoming urgent to consider how the food supply chain can improve it.;;;https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/improving-energy-efficiency-in-the-agro-food-chain/why-does-energy-efficiency-in-the-agro-food-chain-matter_9789264278530-4-en
;;;There has been an ever growing demand for food as the world population grows, along with the increasing demand for higher protein diets. As a result, the agri-food production and processing sector has become a major producer of greenhouse gases (GHGs).;;;
;;;About 30% of global energy is consumed in the agricultural and food sector. Energy is needed at every level of the food value chain, including the production of agricultural inputs, agricultural production in the field, food processing, transportation, marketing and consumption. Primary agriculture consumes only about 20%, whilst food processing including transport uses around 40%, and thereby significantly contributes to global energy consumption along agricultural value chains.;;;https://energypedia.info/wiki/Energy_within_Food_and_Agricultural_Value_Chains

What is climate change? What are the impacts of climate change?;;;"Climate change refers to a change in climate patterns due to human activities, going beyond the natural variability in the climate. This is caused by greenhouse gases emitted into our atmosphere. Among the drivers of these emissions are the burning of fossil fuels, industrial processes, livestock farming, and waste treatment.
The direct impacts which we experience include an increase in the global temperature, rising sea levels and more extreme weather conditions. These impacts have subsequent wide-ranging effects on ecosystems, the economy, society and human health. We have to deal with the consequences while trying to counter the causes of climate change. Climate change-related statistics can help us to understand this whole process better.";;;https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/climate-change/overview
What are the drivers of climate change?;;;"Drivers of climate change are human activities, including economic activities, such as electricity production or cutting down trees, but also leisure activities, such as car journeys; increase in population, over consumption, over production, air conditioners, waste, pollution, wars, huge fires.";;;
What actions have been planned fighting for climate change?;;;"The European Commission addresses the causes and consequences of climate change through European regulations and policies and by being an ambitious partner in the international activities in this field. EU strategy on adaptation to climate change; the green deal;";;;https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets_en
What are the consequences of climate change?;;;"Climate change affects all regions around the world. Polar ice shields are melting and the sea is rising. In some regions extreme weather events and rainfall are becoming more common while others are experiencing more extreme heat waves and droughts.
These impacts are expected to intensify in the coming decades.";;;
;;;Consequences for Europe: Southern and central Europe are seeing more frequent heat waves, forest fires and droughts. The Mediterranean area is becoming drier, making it even more vulnerable to drought and wildfires. Northern Europe is getting significantly wetter, and winter floods could become common. Urban areas, where 4 out of 5 Europeans now live, are exposed to heat waves, flooding or rising sea levels, but are often ill-equipped for adapting to climate change.;;;
;;;Risks for human health and life, Risks for wildlife, Costs for society and economy;;;
What is the consequences of climate change for developing countries?;;;Many poor developing countries are among the most affected. People living there often depend heavily on their natural environment and they have the least resources to cope with the changing climate.;;;
What are the environmental impacts of air conditioning?;;;Energy use. Air conditioners require lots of energy to function properly. It consumes so much electricity and therefore releases pollution.;;;
;;;Air conditioners can sometimes be vital for mere survival. There are places, due to global warming, that are extremely warm and need the presence of coolant. Though this turn into a cycle since ACs contribute to global warming, we undoubtedly still need them in order to survive the rising temperatures, whether it’s at home or in our working spaces.;;;
What are the negatives of air conditioning?;;;"Sudden changes in temperature and humidity affect the respiratory system.
It has a drying effect on skin and mucous membranes.
It adds to ambient noise, contributing to noise pollution.
The air circulation can transmit infectious respiratory diseases.
Airborne dust and fungi can cause allergic reactions.";;;
What are the negative environmental impacts of air conditioning?;;;"CFCs/ HFCs
Air conditioners are complex machines that are made up of many different parts which work in several ways. CFCs and HFCs are both cooling agents that are in the air conditioners which, when released, increases the holes in the ozone over time. Older air conditioners rely on CFC and HFC and contribute to global warming in a major way. Even newer models, which rely more on HFCs and HFOs play a large role in ozone depletion.";;;
;;;Unclean ducts: air conditioners not only affect the environment in a global way, it also affects it on a small scale as well. The ducts in each air conditioner, over time, collect dust and bacteria and every time the air conditioner is turned on, both are released, and are toxic for humans, especially children. There are ductless mini-split brands though that focus more on the environment and safety of people. Ductless mini-split brands are actually more durable and work in warmer climates such as Middle East, Asia and Central and South America.;;;
;;;Materials used: In the past air conditioners were mainly made out of metals. Though over the years, people decided that metal is too expensive and too heavy, so they opted for plastic. Although metal and plastic are both harmful to the environment, plastic is completely non-biodegradable, which makes it an enemy of the environment. The production of plastic alone is extremely detrimental, as it too releases carbon dioxide into the air and causes what we now know as the greenhouse effect.;;;
Is it so that the lower the thermostat setting, the faster the AC cools down a house?;;;When you come home to a hot and stuffy house, you’ll be tempted to turn the AC on and push it down to its lowest setting so you’ll have a cooler home much faster. But the AC doesn’t work this way! The thermostat setting is a target for the air conditioner, and it will run as long as necessary to reach it, wasting power to make a home too cold—and possibly damaging the AC’s indoor coils. We recommend never lowering the thermostat below 70°F.;;;
Is it so that the AC’s filter is there to clean the indoor air;;;Because people often assume the AC filter cleans their air, they don’t regularly replace the filter as long as their air seems fine. But this filter is there to protect the interior of the air conditioner, not clean household air. Unless the filter is changed out every 1 to 3 months, it will hamper AC efficiency and effectiveness.;;;
